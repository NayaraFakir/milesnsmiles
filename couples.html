                    <h2><strong>Croatia</strong></h2>
                      <p>The Republic of Croatia is at the crossroads of Central and Southeastern Europe. The national language is Croatian, but English and German are widely spoken. The coast has a typically Mediterranean climate consisting of hot, dry, sunny weather during summer, and relatively mild – though sometimes wet – weather in winter. A continental climate exists in the interior of Croatia which means that winters can be pretty cold, with temperatures often falling below 0°C/32°F. Snow is very likely, and can be pretty heavy during the winter. Croatia’s pride is its nature, and 10% of the country is protected. The best way to enjoy this is by camping. They boast fantastic watersports, beautiful islands and gorgeous lighthouses. Each region has its unique dishes and seafood is big throughout the country. Make sure you try the oysters. If you’re adventurous, try the famous Maraschino liqueur.</p>
