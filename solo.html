                    <h2><strong>New Zealand </strong></h2>
                      <p> New Zealand is a small country, roughly the size of Great Britain and with a population of only 4 million. Summer temperatures average 20-250C which is fantastic for a warm holiday, while winter temperatures can reach -100C, setting the scene for their popular ski season. New Zealanders (informally known as Kiwis) are famous for their friendliness – a huge plus for a solo traveller! It is the perfect destination whether you are backpacking, camping or luxury holidaying. They have options for all budgets. Fun activities include zip-lining, off-road driving and caving, if you are an adventure junkie. If you are looking for a relaxing vacation, there are plenty of hot pools, vineyards, galleries and museums worth exploring. One of New Zealand’s most unique traits is their <i>Māori</i> culture and you can catch one of their <i>Kapa Haka</i> (traditional <i>Māori</i> performing arts). As for food, seafood is king in New Zealand. Other delicious dishes include roast lamb, <i>Māori hāngī</i>, and the timeless fish and chips. If you are Lord of the Rings fan, you will know New Zealand has been dubbed the ‘’Home of Middle-Earth’’. </p>

There's an indelible buzz to these urban centres, with their vibrant street life, 24-hour drinking and dining scenes, and creative hubs that turn out fashion and pop culture trends consumed the world over. Travel is always smooth and efficient, whether you're using the subway to get around or the <i>shinkansen</i>(bullet trains) to go from one city to the next.</p>
